      <h2>What Is “AI” in the Card Payments Context?</h2>
      <p>
        In the credit card world, artificial intelligence is less about chatbots and more about pattern recognition.
        Models ingest historical transactions, device signals, merchant behaviour and chargeback data to learn what
        “normal” looks like for millions of cardholders and merchants.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a new transaction arrives, these systems compare it against those patterns. Instead of a simple “if amount
        &gt; X then decline”, AI-based engines weigh dozens of factors before recommending approve, decline or
        challenge-with-authentication.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How AI Scores Transactions in Real Time</h2>
      <p>
        During authorisation, AI models compute a risk score based on variables such as merchant type, ticket size,
        location, device reputation, time of day and past account history. This score feeds into the issuer’s decision
        logic alongside traditional checks like available credit and delinquency status.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some programmes also use AI to choose between multiple routing paths or authentication strategies, favouring the
        combination that historically yields high approvals with low fraud for similar profiles.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>AI for Fraud Detection and Abuse Prevention</h2>
      <p>
        Classic fraud rules are good at catching known patterns but struggle with new tactics. AI models help by
        spotting subtle anomalies, such as unusual merchant clusters, sudden travel-like behaviour without travel
        signals, or device fingerprints that appear across many unrelated accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same tooling can address non-traditional abuse, for example gaming of trial offers, manufactured spending or
        unusually dense refund patterns. Rather than blocking entire categories, issuers can apply targeted friction to
        high-risk cases while leaving genuine customers largely unaffected.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Personalisation, Credit Lines and Rewards Tuning</h2>
      <p>
        AI is also used on the constructive side of card programmes. Models can suggest credit line increases, design
        more relevant card offers or adjust the mix of rewards and instalment options visible in the app based on how a
        customer actually uses the card.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some portfolios, AI helps identify when a customer may benefit from extra support — for example, changes in
        repayment patterns that suggest financial stress. This can trigger proactive communication instead of waiting
        for defaults.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Governance, Bias and Transparency</h2>
      <p>
        Because AI touches credit, fraud and rewards, governance is critical. Issuers must document how models are
        trained, which data sources are used and how often performance is checked. Regulatory frameworks increasingly
        expect monitoring for bias, explainability of decisions and clear complaint channels.
      </p>
      <p>
        For cardholders, this means looking not only at the features a programme offers but also at how decisions are
        communicated: can you understand why something was declined, why a limit changed or how a particular offer was
        targeted at you.
