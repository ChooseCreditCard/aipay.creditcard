          “AI” in card systems is more than a buzzword. Behind each authorization, there may be models checking fraud risk, routing transactions and predicting behaviour. This page explains where AI fits in — and what it doesn’t do.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is “AI” in Card Payments?</h2>
      <p>
        In the context of credit cards, “AI” normally means statistical or machine-learning models that
        analyse large volumes of transaction and account data. These models look for patterns that humans
        could not track in real time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal is not magic decision-making. Instead, AI helps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Spot unusual behaviour that might indicate fraud.</li>
        <li>Estimate the risk that a transaction should be declined.</li>
        <li>Route payments across networks or acquirers more efficiently.</li>
        <li>Generate alerts, budgeting insights or recommendations in your app.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Most AI runs silently in the background, triggered each time your card is used.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Where AI is used -->
    <section id="models" class="section">
      <h2>Where AI Shows Up in the Card Journey</h2>
      <p>Typical AI use-cases in card systems include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Real-time fraud checks:</strong> models compare each transaction against your usual patterns
          (location, merchant type, amount, time of day) and global fraud signals.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Risk scoring at authorization:</strong> AI helps decide whether a borderline transaction
          should be approved, declined or challenged (for example with 3-D Secure).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Smart routing & optimisation:</strong> back-end systems choose which network, acquirer or
          route to use to maximise approval rates and minimise costs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Customer insights:</strong> apps use models to categorise spending, forecast bills and show
          personalised suggestions or warnings.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In many cases, these models are continuously retrained on new data to keep up with fraud patterns
        and usage trends.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Impact & risks -->
    <section id="impact" class="section">
      <h2>Benefits, Trade-Offs and Risks</h2>
      <p>AI can improve card systems, but it also introduces trade-offs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Better detection:</strong> fraud can be caught earlier and with fewer false positives.</li>
        <li><strong>Smoother approvals:</strong> good transactions are more likely to go through quickly.</li>
        <li><strong>More tailored experiences:</strong> insights and alerts can be more relevant.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Risks include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Opacity:</strong> decisions may feel like a “black box” if issuers do not explain their logic.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bias & data quality:</strong> models are only as good as their training data and monitoring.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Over-reliance:</strong> both issuers and users may trust AI outputs too much without verification.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Regulators increasingly expect transparency and oversight around how such models are built and used.
